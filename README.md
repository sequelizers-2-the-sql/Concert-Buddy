## ConcertBuddy 2.0
Have you ever had to fly solo to the show? You know what we mean. Maybe that experimental noise-rock duo from Brooklyn is on tour, but your friends aren't really up for ... ahem, "trying new things". Or maybe you're new in town. No friends yet, but you're dying to check out that new Electro-House DJ. But go alone? Feels kind of ... lame, right?

Luckily, you've got ConcertBuddy. Just sign up and join the social network for people like you: music-lovers who aren't afraid to check out shows solo, but wouldn't mind hanging with an equally cool aficionado.

So what are you waiting for? Find your ConcertBuddy.
